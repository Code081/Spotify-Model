# Spotify-Model
This model recognises your facial expressions and trains on the data provided on Kaggle for fer 2013. This project refers to the notebook Detect mood & Recommend Music from saurab kumar on Kaggle. 
I have made a few changes to the notebook and succesfully ran it on my system. 
I also tried a diffrent approch of taking input for the mood from the user manually and scrape data from lyrics of songs using the Genius API. and recommend songs based on the user input which then provides data to the spotify-model.

## To Run the Final Model 
- open the emotion-based-music-recommender-resnet50v2.ipynb
- run all of the code blocks
- you will need Tensorflow, numpy, pandas, keras, matplotlib, sklearn, cv2 as prerequisits to run the model.
- if you wish to run the model on a local machine you can use Miniconda and enable External Gpu support using a Conda Virtual enviourment on WSL2 on windows.
